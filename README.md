# hello-world-fwless
Simple java rest API without framework.

This branch aims to showcase how to use [Dekorate](https://github.com/dekorateio/dekorate) to generate the YAML resources and next deploy this microservice on a kubernetes cluster.

## Set up
This project uses [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for running a Kubernetes cluster locally. You can install it following the instructions [here](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation).
Once installed, we need to set it up in order to :

- Use a local docker registry needed to provide the image of the microservice when the pod is created.
- Install an Ingress controller managing the access from the host to the cluster of the exposed services.


1.  Create a `kind` cluster with a local registry using the following bash script
```
#!/bin/sh
set -o errexit

# create registry container unless it already exists
reg_name='kind-registry'
reg_port='5000'
running="$(docker inspect -f '{{.State.Running}}' "${reg_name}" 2>/dev/null || true)"
if [ "${running}" != 'true' ]; then
  docker run \
    -d --restart=always -p "${reg_port}:5000" --name "${reg_name}" \
    registry:2
fi

# create a cluster with the local registry enabled in containerd
cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --config=-
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  kubeadmConfigPatches:

    kind: InitConfiguration
    nodeRegistration:
      kubeletExtraArgs:
        node-labels: "ingress-ready=true"
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  - containerPort: 443
    hostPort: 443
    protocol: TCP
containerdConfigPatches:
- |-
  [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry.mirrors."localhost:${reg_port}"]
    endpoint = ["http://${reg_name}:${reg_port}"]
EOF

# connect the registry to the cluster network
docker network connect "kind" "${reg_name}"

# tell https://tilt.dev to use the registry
# https://docs.tilt.dev/choosing_clusters.html#discovering-the-registry
for node in $(kind get nodes); do
  kubectl annotate node "${node}" "kind.x-k8s.io/registry=localhost:${reg_port}";
done
```

2. Install the Ingress controller in the cluster.

You can deploy the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) running the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml
```

The environment is now ready. We can generate kubernetes manifests using `Dekorate` and proceed to deploy them.

Let's begin!

# K8s manifests generation and deploy
## Manifests generation
Generating these manifests (YAML files) using `Dekorate` is very easy, you just need to add the proper dependency to the `pom.xml`.

```
 <dependency>
      <groupId>io.dekorate</groupId>
      <artifactId>kubernetes-annotations</artifactId>
      <version>0.13.6</version>
 </dependency>
```

Next, we will add a Java annotation for `Dekorate` to tune the YAML resources. It's possible [to configure Dekorate using](https://github.com/dekorateio/dekorate#usage) Java annotations, configuration properties (application.properties) or both.
In this case we will use, Java annotations, more specificlly  [`@KubernetesApplication`](https://github.com/dekorateio/dekorate#kubernetes) which also gives us access to more Kubernetes specific configuration options.
Edit the App class and add the following annotation.

```
@KubernetesApplication(
        name = "hello-world-fwless-k8s",        
        ports = @Port(name = "web", containerPort = 8080),  
        expose = true, 
        host = "fw-app.127.0.0.1.nip.io", 
        imagePullPolicy = ImagePullPolicy.Always 
)
```
- We need to prevent Dekorate that a Kubernetes Service should be created. A Kubernetes Service is a resource providing a single, constant point of entry to our application. It has an IP address and port that never change while the service exists. Dekorate will generate a Kubernetes Service in the manifest if a **`@Port`** is defined.
- **`expose = true`** controls whether the application should be exposed via an Ingress resource accessible from the outside the cluster.
- The host under which the application is going to be exposed. It's used by the Ingress resource to deliver the queries addresed to that host to our service.
- We use **`Always`** in order to be able to use an updated image.

Trigger the manifests generation. Navigate to the directory and run `mvn clean package`. The generated manifests can be found under `target/classes/META-INF/dekorate`.

## Building and deploying

Now that we have populated YAML kubernetes resources, we are able to deploy the application on the cluster, we must first create a container image and push it to a local container registry.

### Using docker
A basic Dockerfile is provided in the project base directory so you can build the image using the following command:
```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t USERNAME/hello-world-fwless:1.0-SNAPSHOT .
```
To allow the Kubernetes cluster to run it, we need to push the image to the image registry. 
Please, consider registering at http://hub.docker.com or other publicly available registry if you donâ€™t have yet an id and change the id occurrences with your own.
Then, you can push the image using the following command:
```
docker push USERNAME/hello-world-fwless:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

**NOTE** Dekorate [allows the user to trigger container image builds and deploy](https://github.com/dekorateio/dekorate#building-and-deploying) after the end of compilation. So, alternatively, you could also delegate the build of the container image and the manifests deployment using the followings hooks provided by Dekorate:
```
mvn clean package -Ddekorate.build=true  -Ddekorate.push=true
```

Finally, we will deploy the application under the namespace `demo` using the yaml resources with the following command:

```
kubectl create ns demo
kubectl apply -f target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/kubernetes.yml -n demo
```
After a few seconds, check if the application is running and available at the following address opened within your browser `http://fw-app.127.0.0.1.nip.io/api/hello` or do a curl/wget or httpie within a terminal.


### Using jib-maven-plugin

[Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin) is a Maven plugin for building Docker images. Jib simplifies the containerization since with it, we don't need to write a dockerfile. We don't even have to have docker installed to create and publish the docker images ourselves.
Using it via a maven plugin is nice because Jib will catch any changes we make to our application each time we build.

Using [Dekorate build hook](https://github.com/dekorateio/dekorate#jib-build-hook) allows to the users build and push the image even more easily. 
We just need to add the `jib-annotations` dependency in the `pom.xml` file:

```
    <dependencies>
      <groupId>io.dekorate</groupId>
      <artifactId>jib-annotations</artifactId>
    </dependencies>
```

Then, pass `-Ddekorate.build=true` as an argument to the build in order to trigger the image creation and push to the docker registry:

```
mvn clean package -Ddekorate.push=true
```

Finally, we will deploy the application under the namespace `demo` using the yaml resources with the following command:

```
kubectl create ns demo
kubectl apply -f target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/kubernetes.yml -n demo
```

Get the application URL requesting the Ingress:

```
kubectl get ingress -n demo
```

At last, you should be able to access the application by opening a browser to $URL/api/hello
